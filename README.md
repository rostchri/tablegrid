# Tablegrid Rails Gem

## What is this?
* Generic helper for creating table-grid views. 
* The original idea comes from http://coryodaniel.com/index.php/2011/02/16/hamlburgerhelper-sets-the-table-easily-create-and-display-standard-tables-in-rails/ or http://dzone.com/snippets/hamlburger-helper-easily

## Integration in your Rails project: 
* In Gemfile: `gem 'tablegrid', :git => 'https://github.com/rostchri/tablegrid.git'`
* In application.js: `//= require tablegrid`
* In application.css: `*= require tablegrid`

## Requirements:
* Haml

## Example:
* Assuming we have a model named game with some attributes and we want to build a simple table
* Content of games_helper.rb:
	module GamesHelper
    
	  def game_cols
	    cols  = [:id]
	    cols += [:start_at,:parent_and_name] unless parent? || controller?(:leaguecompetitions) || (action?(:filter) && scope?(:by_competitions))
	    cols += [:name] if parent? || controller?(:leaguecompetitions) || (action?(:filter) && scope?(:by_competitions))
	    cols += [:homecompetitor,:guestcompetitor]
	    cols += [:advance,:gameset]  
	    cols += [:created_at,:updated_at]
	  end
  
	  def games_col_visible
	    {:col_visible   => ->(col) {
